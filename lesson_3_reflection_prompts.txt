When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

 This would be useful when working from more than one location, in order to keep changes
 between workstations in sync, when more than one person is working on the same project,
 or when backing up data offsite is desireable.

 Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically 
 stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

 If there are other collaborators working on the code, an auto pull may break some of the
 functionality I'm relying on to make the changes I'm working on. On the other hand, if
 I manually pull, I can ensure that there are no conflicts by engagin in conflict resolution
 on my own.

 Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

  A fork is when you clone code from a GitHub repository into your own user area in GitHub.
  This is useful when you want to start working on a project someone else has started, but 
  want to take it in your own direction.

  A clone is a direct and exact copy of a repository into another repository. This is
  used when you want to work on the code from a location other than the original machine
  the data is stored on, or if you want to create a new project off of the backbone of the
  contents of the repository being cloned.

  A branch is when you deviate from code in your own repository for the purposes of anything
  from adding new funtionality while maintaining a working copy, performing localization, or
  just testing new features.

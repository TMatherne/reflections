What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

 When you init a repo, git sets up metadata in the folder, readying git to
 track the files within that folder, but not yet doing anything until it 
 is told. To add files to git tracking, you need to manually add files to the repo.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

 The staging area allows you to see what changes are waiting to be written
 into the repo. This is different from the working directory, as the wd includes
 all the files within it, while the staging area only includes those tracked by 
 git that are waiting to be written into the active repo.

 The value in this is that it allows you to keep track of how many changes you've
 made, and choose when to create commits before things get out of hand in size.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history
